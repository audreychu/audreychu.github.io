  <h2>Professional Profile</h2>
  <img src="Grad_10.png"  width="250" align="right">
<p>
  Audrey is a New Jersey native pursuing a <b>BA in Applied Statistics</b> and a <b>BS in Managerial Economics</b> at the University of California, Davis. After graduation this June, she hopes to integrate her acquired STEM and business knowledge in the actuarial sciences industry. An <a href="http://www.beanactuary.org/what/" target="_blank">actuary</a>, as she first learned of the career in 2014, is a professional who analyzes the financial consequences of risk. They use mathematics, computer science, and statistical theory to study uncertain future events, especially those of concern to insurance. Audrey took her first step towards the career path when she passed her first actuarial exam (Exam 1/Probability) in September 2015.
<br>
<br>
  During the summer after her junior year of college, Audrey worked at the headquarters of <a href="https://www.libertymutualgroup.com/about-lm/news/liberty-mutual-insurance-news" target="_blank">Liberty Mutual Insurance</a> in Boston, Massachusetts as an actuarial intern. There, she learned an incredible amount about the career as well as strengthened her technical and analytic problem-solving skills for the Global Specialty Reinsurance Data Science and Actuarial Unit.  Her responsibilities included parameterizing weibull and pareto statistical distributions with increased limit factors for curve fitting in exposure based rating.  Her analysis was primarily on reinsurance pricing treaties dealing with professional (D&O or E&O) and medical malpractice liabilities.  Upon completing her internship, Audrey was offered a full-time job in Liberty Mutualâ€™s Actuarial Development Program in Boston or Seattle. She is currently deciding between Liberty Mutual and another employer.
<br>	
<br>
  Having returned to Davis to finish her studies, Audrey also returns to her on-campus job as an Admissions Student Assistant at the <a href="http://gsm.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">UC Davis Graduate School of Management</a>. There, she works on data and application vetting for MBA, MS Professional Accounting, and MS Business Analytics prospects. Additionally, she is currently studying for her second actuarial exam (Exam 2/Financial Mathematics) and will sit for the exam in February 2017.
<br>
<br>
  In her free time, Audrey enjoys discovering new music and watching documentaries. She is an avid coffee drinker; actually, she is sort of a coffee addict. She also tries to take advantage of the west coast weather as much as possible.
